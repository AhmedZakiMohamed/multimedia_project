      <p>Deadpool is a 2016 American superhero comedy film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Directed by Tim Miller (in his directorial debut) and written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, it is a spin-off of the X-Men film series and its overall eighth installment. The film stars Ryan Reynolds in the title role, alongside Morena Baccarin, Ed Skrein, T.J. Miller, Gina Carano, and Brianna Hildebrand. In the film, Wade Wilson hunts the man responsible for giving him mutant abilities and a scarred physical appearance, becoming the antihero Deadpool.

        Following a greenlight from 20th Century Fox in 2014, principal photography took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, between March and May 2015. Several vendors provided visual effects for the film, ranging from the addition of blood and gore to creation of the CGI character Colossus. Deadpool premiered at the Le Grand Rex in Paris on February 8, 2016, and was released in the United States on February 12, following an unconventional marketing campaign.
        
        The film achieved both financial and critical success, earning $782 million against a $58 million budget, becoming the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2016 and breaking numerous records, including the highest-grossing film in the X-Men series and the highest-grossing R-rated film at the time. Critics praised Reynolds' performance, the film's style, faithfulness to the comics and action sequences, though some criticized the plot as formulaic. The film received many awards and nominations, including two Critics' Choice awards and two Golden Globe nominations. Two sequels have been released: Deadpool 2 (2018) and Deadpool & Wolverine (2024), with the latter being part of Phase Five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>
